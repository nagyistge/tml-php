He was known colloquially as \"the [link6: father of] the [link7: hydrogen bomb]\". Teller was an immigrant to the United States during the 1930s, and was an early member of the [link8: Manhattan Project] to develop the first atomic bombs. During this time he made a serious push for the first time to develop [link9: fusion]-based weapons as well, but they were deferred until after the war. After his controversial testimony in the security clearance hearing of his former [link10: Los Alamos] colleague [link11: Robert Oppenheimer], Teller became ostracized by much of the scientific community. He continued to find support from the U.S. government and military research establishment. He was a co-founder of [link12]Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory[/link12], and was both director and associate director for many years. In his later years he became especially known for his advocacy of controversial technological solutions to both military and civilian problems, including a plan to excavate an artificial [link13: harbor] in [link14: Alaska] using thermonuclear explosives. Over the course of his long life, Teller was known both for his scientific ability and his difficult interpersonal relations, and is considered one of the key influences of the character [link15: Dr. Strangelove] in the {num} movie of the same name.

Fluoridated water has fluoride at a level that is effective for preventing cavities; this can occur naturally or by adding fluoride. Fluoridated water operates on tooth surfaces: in the mouth it creates low levels of fluoride in [link4: saliva], which reduces the rate at which [link5: tooth enamel] demineralizes and increases the rate at which it remineralizes in the early stages of cavities. Typically a fluoridated compound is added to drinking water, a process that in the U.S. costs an average of about {price} per person-year. Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits. A {num} [link6]World Health Organization[/link6] expert committee suggested a level of fluoride from {num1} to {num2}0 mg/L ([link7: milligrams] per [link8: liter]), depending on climate. Dental cavities remain a major [link9: public health] concern in most [link10]industrialized countries[/link10], affecting 60–{num3}% of schoolchildren and the vast majority of adults, and costing society more to treat than any other disease. Water fluoridation prevents cavities in both children and adults, with studies estimating an 18–{num4}% reduction in cavities when water fluoridation is used by children who already have access to toothpaste and other sources of fluoride. There is no clear evidence of [link11: adverse effects] other than [link12: dental fluorosis]. It is controversial, and [link13: opposition to it] has been based on ethical, legal, safety, and efficacy grounds.
