After his controversial testimony in the security clearance hearing of his former [link10: Los Alamos] colleague [link11: Robert Oppenheimer], Teller became ostracized by much of the scientific community. He continued to find support from the U.S. government and military research establishment. He was a co-founder of [link12]Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory[/link12], and was both director and associate director for many years. In his later years he became especially known for his advocacy of controversial technological solutions to both military and civilian problems, including a plan to excavate an artificial [link13: harbor] in [link14: Alaska] using thermonuclear explosives. Over the course of his long life, Teller was known both for his scientific ability and his difficult interpersonal relations, and is considered one of the key influences of the character [link15: Dr. Strangelove] in the {num} movie of the same name.

She essentially established the historical romance genre and its subgenre [link6: Regency romance]. To ensure accuracy, Heyer kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life. While some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the detail to be her greatest asset. Beginning in 1932, Heyer released one romance novel and one [link7: thriller] each year. Her husband often provided basic plot outlines for the thrillers, leaving Heyer to develop character relationships and dialogue. Although many critics describe Heyer's detective novels as unoriginal, others praise them for their wit and plots. Her success was sometimes clouded by problems with tax inspectors and alleged plagiarists.
