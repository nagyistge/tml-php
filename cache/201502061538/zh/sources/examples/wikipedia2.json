            "label": "[strong][link: Georgette Heyer][\/strong] (1902\u201374) was a British [link1: historical romance] and [link2: detective fiction] novelist. Her writing career began in 1921, when she turned a story for her younger brother into the novel [em][link3: The Black Moth][\/em] [em](title page pictured)[\/em]. After [em][link4: These Old Shades][\/em] became popular despite its release during the [link5: General Strike], Heyer determined that publicity was not necessary for good sales and refused to give interviews thereafter. She essentially established the historical romance genre and its subgenre [link6: Regency romance]. To ensure accuracy, Heyer kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life. While some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the detail to be her greatest asset. Beginning in 1932, Heyer released one romance novel and one [link7: thriller] each year. Her husband often provided basic plot outlines for the thrillers, leaving Heyer to develop character relationships and dialogue. Although many critics describe Heyer's detective novels as unoriginal, others praise them for their wit and plots. Her success was sometimes clouded by problems with tax inspectors and alleged plagiarists. Heyer continued writing until her death; her last book, [em][link8: My Lord John][\/em], was published posthumously. ([link][strong: Full\u00a0article...][\/link])",
